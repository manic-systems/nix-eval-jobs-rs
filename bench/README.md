# bench

Differential equivalence harness and benchmark for evix's evaluation, with
nix-eval-jobs as the reference. Run from a `nix develop` shell, which provides
`jq`, `hyperfine`, and `nix-eval-jobs`.

## `fixture.nix`

A parameterized `recurseForDerivations` tree of `breadth^(depth+1)` trivial,
distinct derivations. Shared by both scripts. Args: `system`, `breadth`,
`depth`. The derivations are never built; only their `.drv` is computed, so
evaluation is the only cost.

## `equiv.sh`: correctness

```bash
# Run without arguments
$ bench/equiv.sh            # sweeps a few breadth/depth shapes

# Or more fine grained
$bench/equiv.sh 6 3        # one shape
```

Asserts two invariants and exits non-zero on any divergence:

1. **Topology invariance**: evix emits the identical set of `drvPath`s whether
   run with 1 local worker, 8 local workers, or 4 remote workers. Splitting the
   work must not change the result.
2. **Reference equivalence**: that set matches `nix-eval-jobs` on the same
   input. Skipped with a warning if `nix-eval-jobs` is not on `PATH`.

The same invariant is checked at the unit level, over randomly generated
attribute graphs and worker topologies, in `crates/evix/src/async_master.rs`
(`distributed_eval_is_topology_invariant`,
`distributed_eval_fails_when_a_system_is_unowned`).

## `bench.sh`: performance

```bash
bench/bench.sh           # breadth=6 depth=3  (1296 derivations)
bench/bench.sh 5 3
```

Runs `hyperfine` over evix at 1/4/8 local workers, evix over a remote worker,
and nix-eval-jobs. Writes `bench/results.md`.
